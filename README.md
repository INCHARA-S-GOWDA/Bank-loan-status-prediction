PROBLEM STATEMENT

To design and develop “Bank Loan Status Predictor” having the following features:

a) To read, analyse, preprocess the given training dataset producing the Pre-processed data.

b) To execute and verify all the applicable Classifier algorithms on the pre-processed dataset.

c) Identify the most suitable classifier out of these classifiers based on the testing data accuracy 
values.

d) To predict the Bank Loan Approval status classification values for the given Customer data 
using the finalized classifier

e) To get the predicted Bank Loan Approval Status values based on the inputs provided

Data preparation is a crucial step in the machine learning (ML) pipeline that involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format suitable for training and evaluating ML models. Proper data preparation can significantly impact the performance and effectiveness of a machine learning model.FIRST run the Loan_Prediction_Data_Preparation.ipynb file using "loan_data.csv" dataset.The cleaned dataset "preprocess_loan_data.csv" will be created and it will be saved in the drive. SECOND using the "preprocess_loan_data.csv" run the Solving_Loan_Prediction_problem_using_MLModels (1).ipynb
